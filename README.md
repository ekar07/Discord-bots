# Discord.JS-bots
Bots made for fun used on a personal discord server using discord.js.  These were just fun little projects to learn how to make bots.  
Most of these are intended just to annoy my friends (which succeeded) :)

Description of each bot:

1) Smilebot.js: monitors text channels in Discord for curse words and chews out user if it detects one

2) RiffRaffRadio.js: plays a random song from Riff Raff in the voice channel

3) Meiling.js: plays a random proverb from Mei Ling in the voice channel
